# Newsfeed system

CMS applicattion for creating and serving news

### Base technologies
- HTML/CSS/JS
- AngularJS
- Django (Python)

### Basic Environment Installation
##### Backend
So, we need a python. Make sure you have one (3.6 recommended). Then you can install Django by using pip. Like this:
>pip install -r requirements

And that's it. Of course you've got to have this repo locally.

##### Frontend
Download Node.js from here https://nodejs.org/en/
Be sure if you installed npm as well. Then run your CLI (or command window or whatever) and type:
>npm install

And to create a bundle.js file type once:
>webpack

All dependencies should install automatically. Everything should be ready.

Except angular following extensions are needed:

- Typescript
- ES6
- Webpack

Well, typescript and ES6 are just "remanagement" of common javascript code. You write clean, clear and wonderful code with modules, imports and everything which every MODERN language should have. You write a poem, but it's not readable for those crappy tools, which called themsleves a browser. So we need a webpack to retranslate it just for our browser. Poor browser.

##### How to use webpack
Well, webpack is a great tool for every sized project, it's easy to manage, it's easy to work with. But it has it's own lectures, and you need to know them. Not all of them, but some, Just to now how to us it.
I mean, it's pretty easy here, you just type

>webpack -w

and webpack is watching your files during your work. But what if you want to add some extension or use a widget or whatever? It's a little bit more complicated than this, so please, make yourself sure you'd understand the subject, because I don't want to answer every stupid question ten times a day. I've got life. I hope you either. Save your time by lecture. And mine too.

###### Webpack

###### Typescript

###### Combined

Yeah, with angular it looks a little bit strange. But don't worry, it's because of those loooooooong types.

And remember. Those are just *examples*. There are bunches of videos about that. You just have to keep learning and write a code by yourself.
